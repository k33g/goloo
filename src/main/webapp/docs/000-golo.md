###Golo?

**[Golo](http://golo-lang.org/)** is a lightweight dynamic language for the JVM. It' s the language of the **[Doctor](https://github.com/jponge)**. What! Another one! (language, not the Doctor). Yes, again, but it's cute, extremely lightweight (**361 KB!**), very powerful (**Golo enjoys the power of Java**) and brilliantly stylish.
