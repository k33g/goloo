###GolOO?

Gol**OO** is a tiny 'REST' web framework that runs only on GAE. **HIS** language is **[Golo](http://golo-lang.org/)**. The technical stack is composed of various components :

- Golo (and Java), Jackson for the "Backend Side"
- Backbone (Underscore, jQuery) and YepNope for the "Front Side"

The "avowed" aim of Goloo is to build **[Single Page Applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)**. GolOO is young, so there are a plenty of good things to come. Stay tuned.
